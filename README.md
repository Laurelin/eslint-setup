# eslint-setup
 This is my eslint/prettier setup for Next.js framework. It automatically formats semicolons, whitespace, and quotes - all you need to do is save your file.

### Setup

`npm i -D prettier-eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-airbnb `

Then copy paste to your .eslintrc file from here. Or clone my file.

Create Next App should have already installed eslint and eslint-config-next, but if not you will need to add those to your dev dependencies as well.

I've included my VScode settings.json in case you have any issues. Also, I strongly recommend the Cascadia Code font family - it makes your arrows and comparison operators look much nicer.
